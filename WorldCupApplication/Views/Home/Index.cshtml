                    The 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™ is drawing ever nearer – with just 15 days to go! Between now and the start of the World Cup, we will take a closer look at a different statistic from the history of the tournament each day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    15 - The Round of 16 at the 1986 FIFA World Cup™ will forever be associated with the name of Emilio Butragueno and a shock '1-5' scoreline. The striker scored four goals for Spain against Denmark to put the match beyond the reach of the tournament’s dark horses and fire his country into the last eight.

                    "I felt a bit strange. I wasn’t a great goalscorer but I got lucky that day and won two penalties. I just saw it as a one-off. I swapped jerseys with Michael Laudrup at the end, and I’ve still got his shirt at home. My father, who was in the stands with my future wife, was ecstatic. He was over the moon but I was pretty relaxed about it," he said. Butragueno ended the tournament as the second-highest goalscorer.

                    Danny Welbeck: ‘I’m not just a fighter, I like to give love as well’
                </h1>
                <p>
                    There might be quite a few people who are surprised to learn the identity of the player in Gareth Southgate’s squad who will be going to Russia for the World Cup as the leading scorer within the England setup. But here’s a clue: it is not Harry Kane. Or not yet, anyway.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps this might also be an appropriate moment to point out that Danny Welbeck – one of the players who regularly seems to get the pitchfork treatment on social media – has managed more goals in England’s colours than Jamie Vardy, Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford put together. Fifteen, in total, from 37 appearances, though on only 10 occasions has he has played the full 90 minutes. Kane is next in line, with 12 goals from 23 caps (13 full appearances). Nobody else is in double figures and it is worth bearing in mind that four different England managers – Southgate, Roy Hodgson, Fabio Capello and Stuart Pearce on caretaker duty – have selected Welbeck in his seven years as an international footballer. When he is fit, he tends to get the call.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately for Welbeck, that has not been as often as he would have liked since he signed for Arsenal from Manchester United in 2014. First it was the cartilage in his left knee that required major surgery. Then it was a similar problem in his right knee and another long, demoralising layoff. Welbeck missed Euro 2016 because of the second operation and it does not need long in his company to realise these have been the hardest times of his career.

                    “It’s not been easy to deal with,” he says. “It’s difficult. It’s a lonely period. You are not out on the pitch helping your team-mates and doing what you love doing. I had so much time on my hands. Straight after surgery I couldn’t put any weight on my leg for two months. I went through a period of not even leaving my house. Then, after six weeks, when I went back to training, I was literally going just there and straight back home, reading books and stuff like that. But you can learn about yourself and improve mentally. I read more books than when I was in school. Sports mentality books and autobiographies.”
